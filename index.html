      <h1>Heat Detector's FAQ</h1>
      <p>Stack Exchange has provided a <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/327148/5292302">feed of offensive comments</a> which allows for testing and serves a base for the classifying algorithms. However, <b>do not use this as a witch hunt to find users and harass them</b>.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Commenting back on a SO post to a heated comment is, in general, a very bad idea. Avoid commenting in most, if not all cases. A Room Owner might decide to stop the bot if the room is involved in any bad situation (using the command <code>@Queen stop feed</code>) and kick the users involved.</li>
        <li>It is not allowed to speak about the users that posted reported comments in the chat room. We do <b>not</b> moderate users, but comments.</li>
        <li>When multiple offensive comments are exchanged or someone is going well over the top, please remember to flag the thread for moderator intervention. They are not automatically notified of the comments' deletion.</li>
        <li><code>tp</code> should be used for "not nice" comments or comments that lead to offensive ones or offensive / spam posts (answer / question). You can flag the comment or the post approprietly.</li>
        <li><code>tp socvr</code> can be used to send a notification to the <a href="http://socvr.org/">SOCVR room</a>. This should only be used when the comment is very rude and requires immediate attention to avoid flam posts and / or repeatingly offense from other users.</li>
        <li><code>fp</code> should be used for comments that were wrongly reported (i.e. they are on-topic and constructive).</li>
        <li>It is up to you to give feedback when and if you want to. You can abstain from giving one if you feel the comment is hard to classify (borderline).</li>
