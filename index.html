      <p>SE have provided us with a <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/327148/5292302">feed and allows testing</a>, however stating clearly <b>We do request that you don't use this as a witchhunt to find users and harass them</b>, to comply users in chat needs to follow these rules:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Commenting back on reports is strictly prohibited. Users found leaving comments on the SO post when acting on reports will be kicked from SOCVFinder chat room, and RO's should terminate the comment feed until issue is not solved using the command <code>@Queen stop feed</code>.</li>
        <li>It is not allowed to speak about the users involved in SOCVFinder chat room. We do <b>not</b> moderate users, but comments.</li>
        <li>When multiple offensive comments are exchanged, flag the thread for moderator intervention and move on.</li>
        <li><code>tp</code> should be used for "not nice" comments or comments that lead to offensive ones or offensive / spam posts (answer / question). You can flag the comment or the post approprietly.</li>
        <li><code>tp socvr</code> can be used to send a notification to the <a href="http://socvr.org/">SOCVR room</a>. This should only be used when the comment is very rude and requires immediate attention to avoid flam posts and / or repeatingly offense from other users.</li>
        <li><code>fp</code> should be used for comments that were wrongly reported (i.e. they are on-topic and constructive).</li>
        <li>It is up you to give feedback when and if you want to. You can abstain from giving one if you feel the comment is hard to classify (borderline).</li>
